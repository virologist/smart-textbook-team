# Changelog

All notable changes to **smart-textbook-team** are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Enable IMA OpenAPI for citation verification (currently static + offline)
- Add CHANGELOG note for A+B integration findings (see `tb-writer/docs/2026-09-10-ab-integrated-integration-report.md`)
- Hook system for member-to-member injection detection (harness §1.1 enhancement)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- `role-assembly.md` — single source of truth for multi-expert role assembly (replaces external `expert-pool.yaml` reference)
- `install.sh` (macOS/Linux) — cross-platform installer with `--target` selector
- `install.ps1` (Windows PowerShell) — cross-platform installer with `-Target` selector
- `LICENSE` (MIT) and `CHANGELOG.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` — preparation for public release
- Bilingual README (Chinese / English) with platform support matrix and uninstall instructions

### Changed
- `plugin.json`: removed placeholder `email` (full anonymity), replaced PNG avatar references with emoji fallback (no PNG assets shipped)
- `subject-writer.md`: rewrote role-assembly reference from external `expert-pool.yaml` to internal `role-assembly.md` (closes cross-team dependency)
- `agent-harness-protocol/SKILL.md`: added explicit "layer distinction" between tool-level retry and task-level retry (closes semantic ambiguity)
- `smart-textbook-team-team-lead.md`: added `version: 2.0.0` (was missing after evo-11/13 compaction), W2/W3/W4 workflows now declare prerequisites
- `plugin.json`: `tags` and `quickPrompts` arrays preserved unchanged

### Fixed
- **BUG-1 (P0)**: subject-writer reference to external `expert-pool.yaml` was broken (file outside the team, no path declaration, role_id naming mismatch, missing `examines` field). Now references `role-assembly.md` inside the team.
- **BUG-2 (P1)**: semantic ambiguity between `E1 retry ≤3` (tool-level degradation chain) and harness `same-approach retry ≤2` (task-level). Explicitly distinguished.
- **BUG-3 (P1)**: boundary filter and token budget rules in `agent-harness-protocol` were unreachable for members. Added explicit "member-side safety obligation" in team-lead and a dispatch checklist item in harness §7.
- **BUG-4 (P2)**: `team-lead.md` was missing `version: 2.0.0` field after evo-11/13 compaction. Restored.
- **BUG-5 (P2)**: W2/W3/W4 workflows declared "skip X" without declaring prerequisites. Each now states what input must already exist.

### Tests
- `tests/test_smart_textbook_team.py` — **1.000 / 1.000** (183 checks, 0 fail)
- `tests/test_triz_invention_team.py` — **1.000 / 1.000** (regression, 0 fail)
- Red-team audit — 5 bugs found via 32-perspective parallel analysis, all fixed in commit `d2da143`

## [1.x] - Evolution History

This package evolved from `content-forge v5` (tb-writer project) through **evo-1 to evo-13** iterative cycles:

- **evo-1**: Initial team scaffold with 5 agents
- **evo-2**: 1.000 score on internal test suite
- **evo-3 to evo-7**: Harness protocol upgrades — role matrix, message envelopes, state blackboard, retry/timeout/budget, circuit breaker
- **evo-8**: Red-team + Darwin audit — injection defense, examination verification, blackboard anti-poisoning, budget reconciliation, sender authentication, cache discipline, version discipline (1.0.0 → 1.1.0-1.2.0)
- **evo-9**: LEARN candidate pool — first activation, deadlock resolution, degradation fatigue cooling, cross-`task_id` retry counting, side-effect boundary check; harness v1.2; R-class protection 32 → 37
- **evo-10**: Three-pronged deep evaluation — examination-explosion contradiction unification, retry rounds 4→3 alignment, first real LEARN candidate import (ch06 field practice 3 items), R12 semantic sync
- **evo-11**: Compact team-lead from 22KB to 6.8KB (-69%); 154 → 347 baseline checks all green; safety C→B+
- **evo-12 / 12a**: P2 candidate merge, schema-versioned patches
- **evo-13**: Final hardening before v2.0.0 release
